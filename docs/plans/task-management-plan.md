# Task Management Feature Plan

## Objective

To implement a comprehensive task management system for users of AI agents within the Next.js application, using Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL database operations and the Vercel AI SDK for AI integration.

## Steps to Implement

1. **Database Preparation**:
    - Introduce a new schema table `tasks` for managing tasks related data such as:
        - task_id (Primary Key)
        - description (Text)
        - status (Enum: Completed/Pending)
        - user_id (Foreign Key referencing `user` table)
        - created_at, updated_at (Timestamps)

2. **Tool Development**:
    - Define new tools for task management within the `src/lib/ai/tools` directory.
    - Implement task management operations (create, read, update, delete) within these tools, similar to the existing `webSearch` tool.
    - The tools will make use of Drizzle ORM directly for database operations.

3. **Agent Integration**:
    - Extend the functionality of the existing `BaseAgent` in `base.agent.ts` to utilize the newly created task management tools.
    - Implement methods for task analysis, creation, modification, and retrieval using these tools, ensuring seamless execution within the agent's context.

4. **Testing**:
    - Develop unit and integration tests for all new task management functionalities.
    - Verify correctness of tool execution, Drizzle ORM database interactions, and overall agent logic.

5. **Documentation**:
    - Update the documentation to reflect the newly developed tools and any changes in the agent integration.
    - Provide guidelines for developers on how to extend or maintain the task management tools.

## Expected Outcome

By executing this plan, we'll have a robust task management feature integrated directly with our AI agents, enabling efficient and seamless task handling within our existing system architecture.
